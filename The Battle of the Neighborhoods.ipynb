By all accounts, it is among the most diverse and multicultural cities in the world, with 200 ethnic groups and over 140 languages spoken, creating a vibrant and diverse culture.\nMoreover, as health and wellness trends in food and drink products have increasingly gathered momentum in the past years, opening a Greek restaurant in Toronto that is based on the traditional Mediterranean diet could be a quite lucrative business. \nWhile there are a number of factors that would determine the success of such a venture, my analysis with focus on identifying the ideal location for a Greek restaurant in Toronto."
